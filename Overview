This project is about creating a custom health checker. 
The Health Checker will make use of a Lambda (Scripted in python and uses the boto3 library). 
The lambda will create an Eventbridge rule that will scan for Open issues for all services on the AWS Health Dashboard.
It will then post its findings to Amazon Q(Previously labelled aws chatbot). 
The chatbot will then post its findings and status to Microsoft Teams
